# Sharif Connect
Conenct to Sharif networks automatically in all platforms.

# Setup & Run
After downlaoding the [last release](https://github.com/armanexplorer/Sharif-Connect/releases/latest) and extracting it, you will have two choices:

## Bash-based / Batch-based (Recommended)
1. For Windows / Linux, open `connect.bat` / `connect.sh` file accordingly and edit the username and password lines based on your account information.

2. Run updated file (the `.sh` file should get the execute permission using `chmod u+x connect.sh`)


## Python-based
1. Install `python3`

2. Open the `credentials.txt` file and edit the username and password lines

3. For run in Windows, just double click `sharif_connect.bat` file, and for Linux, run `./sharif_connect.py` in terminal (after adding execute permission using `chmod u+x sharif_connect.py`)
